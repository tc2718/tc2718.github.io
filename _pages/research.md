## Diagnosing Model Performance Under Distribution Shift
**Tiffany Cai**, Steve Yadlowsky, Hongseok Namkoong

[Paper link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02011), [GitHub link](https://github.com/namkoong-lab/disde)


Under revision at [Operations
Research](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/opre); presented at [FORC 2023](https://responsiblecomputing.org/forc-2023/), [INFORMS 2023](https://meetings.informs.org/wordpress/phoenix2023/)
<details>
  <summary>Summary</summary>
When a model performs poorly out of distribution, how do we understand why performance became worse? We attribute change in model performance across distributions to X shifts and Y\|X shifts.

Poster at [ICLR 2024 Workshop: Generative Models for Decision
Making](https://sites.google.com/view/genai4dm-iclr2024)

<details>
  <summary>Summary</summary>
We recast the problem of principled decision-making under uncertainty (Thompson Sampling) as autoregressive sequential modeling, trained via loss minimization.

<details>
  <summary>Summary</summary>
We recast the problem of creating asymptotically efficient estimators for the average treatment effect as constrained optimization.
