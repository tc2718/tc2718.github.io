## Diagnosing Model Performance Under Distribution Shift
**Tiffany Cai**, Steve Yadlowsky, Hongseok Namkoong

When a model performs poorly out of distribution, how do we understand why
performance became worse? We attribute change in model performance 
across distributions to X shifts and Y|X shifts.

Under revision at [Operations
Research](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/opre); presented at [FORC 2023](https://responsiblecomputing.org/forc-2023/), [INFORMS 2023](https://meetings.informs.org/wordpress/phoenix2023/)

## Posterior Sampling via Autoregressive Generation
Kelly Wang Zhang\*, **Tiffany Cai$\***, Hongseok Namkoong, Daniel Russo

We recast the problem of principled decision-making under uncertainty
(Thompson Sampling) as autoregressive sequential modeling. 

Forthcoming

To be presented at [ICLR 2024 Workshop: Generative Models for Decision
Making](https://sites.google.com/view/genai4dm-iclr2024)

## Constrained Learning for Causal Inference and Semiparametric Statistics
**Tiffany Cai\***, Yuri Fonseca\*, Kaiwen Hou, Hongseok Namkoong

We recast the problem of creating asymptotically efficient estimators for the 
average treatment effect as constrained optimization.
