I am a PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](http://stat.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University.
I am advised by [Hongseok Namkoong](https://hsnamkoong.github.io/).

I am interested in the intersection of machine learning, distribution shift, causal inference, bayesian statistics, and decision making.

Please feel free to get in touch!
